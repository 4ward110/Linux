> Note: Sections 1, 5, 8 are what you will likely use most often

## 2. Hands on

- Use `man + option + command to search` (ex: `man -k which`) command look through the manual.

- When you hit this command => a number of output appear with format: `name of certain manual pages have command you have search + (session of manual)`. ex: `which (1)`

- You can go deeper by use command: `man + (session of command) + session name`.

> note: if your session of command is `1` => you don't need pass it into to command.

- when you read the session i think you have confuse about some command input require like `[THING], <THING>, THING..., THING1 | THING2,...` => It's call ``Command Synopsis``. And here is the cheat sheet for them.
